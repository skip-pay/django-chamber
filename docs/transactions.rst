Transaction helpers
===================


``chamber.utils.transaction``
------------------------------------

.. function:: smart_atomic(using=None, savepoint=True, ignore_errors=None)

    Like django ``transaction.smart_atomic()`` decorator chamber atomic can be used for surrounding method, function or block of code with db atomic block.

.. function:: pre_commit(callable, using=None)

    Similar to django ``on_commit`` helper, but callable function is called just before the data is committed to the database. If no atomic block is activated callable is called immediately.

.. function:: in_atomic_block(callable, using=None)

    The function checks if your code is in the atomic block.


``chamber.utils.transaction.UniquePreCommitCallable``
-----------------------------------------------------

One time callable is registered and called only once. But all input parameters are stored inside list of kwargs.

.. class:: chamber.utils.transaction.UniquePreCommitCallable

    .. method:: handle()

        There should be implemented code that will be invoked after success pass though the code.

    .. method:: _get_unique_id()

        The uniqueness of the handler must be somehow defined. You must implement this method to define unique identifier of the handler. By default it is identified with has of the class


``chamber.models.handlers.InstanceOneTimePreCommitHandler``
-------------------------------------------------------------

Special type of unique handler that is identified with itself and model instance of the input model object.

.. class:: chamber.utils.transaction.InstanceOneTimePreCommitHandler

    .. method:: _get_instance()

        Returns instance stored in input kwargs which is refreshed from database to get actual state of the model object
